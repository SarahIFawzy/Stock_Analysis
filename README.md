# Multi-Year Stock Analysis #

## VBA Code ##

This project was to analyze large amounts of market data across three years.  

* This script identifies the number of rows in the raw data, identifies when a new Ticker is listed, and summarizes the data for each Ticker: annual variance, % variance, and total stock volume for the year

* After the initial summary, a second table is created that lists the ticker with the largest % variance, the smallest % variance, and the largest stock volume for that year

* The scriipt then repeats that analysis for the following years
